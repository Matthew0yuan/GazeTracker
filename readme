Windows single-camera gaze tracker (screen intersection only)
MediaPipe TASKS FaceLandmarker (NO mp.solutions) + High-accuracy regression + Stable 9pt affine quick-cal.

CPU smoothness improvements:
- Run FaceLandmarker at fixed INFER_FPS (e.g., 25-30), NOT every frame.
- Camera buffer size = 1 to avoid latency build-up.
- Separate inference resolution (smaller) from display resolution.
- Only run ML prediction when a NEW landmark packet arrives.

Install:
  pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn mediapipe

Model:
  Put face_landmarker.task next to this script.

Run:
  python eyetrack.py

Keys:
  ESC   : quit
  SPACE : Quick 9-point recalibration (fullscreen 3x3) -> affine correction (stable, no divergence)
  R     : clear quick-cal correction (back to base)
